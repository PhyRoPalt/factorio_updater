    I am not a coding genuis, i'm sure someone will do this better then me,
    but i wanted to do this, so i did :)
    Code may contain bugs and spelling errors, changelog may not be updated whith everything i've changed/fixed (i forget stuff)
    Various gramatical and spelling errors.
    No actual cake was hurt during the making of this script. enjoy
